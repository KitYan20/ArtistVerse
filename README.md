# CS411Group2

For our web application, we have decided to come up with two ideas of either devleoping a music streaming app and a educational website. For the music streaming app, we were thinking of this app generating a list of music options for the users based on their search history and user preferences. For the tech stack, we were thinking of going with MySql, Flask, Node.js for the backend. We'll be using Javascript and HTML/CSS for the frontend. For the APIs, we were thinking of using a Spotify API to get the music options and maybe a searching API to list the details of each song. We'll also be using the Ticketmaster API to generate a list events through the users artist input. We'll also create a login page so it can store the users login infos in a database.

For the second idea, we were thinking of creating a educational website. What this educational website does is that it teaches student the different algorithms that they'll be learning if they ever want to study CS. For the tech stack, we're thinking of going with HTML/CSS, and Javascript. For the databases, we're going to be using MySQL to store the users login information. For the two APIs, we're thinking of an API that can show statistics of how the students did during their understandings learning CS. It could be based on correctness, time efficiency.
